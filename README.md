# Basic Functions

This file is just a small collection of Python functions I use regularly in different scripts.  
Nothing fancy — just little helpers that save time when writing code.

# What’s inside

A mix of simple, reusable bits of code for things like:
- Cleaning and formatting data
- Running quick calculations
- Small quality-of-life shortcuts that make bigger scripts less messy

The idea is to keep these in one place so I don’t have to rewrite the same thing over and over again.

# Why this exists

If you’ve ever opened an old script and thought,  
“Wait… I already wrote this somewhere else,”  
you’ll understand why. This file is my attempt at not reinventing the wheel every other week.

## How to use

Just import whatever you need into your main script:
Thats it
